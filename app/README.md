# App
This is a template for a new app. Typically something with a build process of some kind.

# Directories
- `bug`: file issues here, e.g. `bug/double-refunds`
- `build`: put build scripts and artifacts here, e.g. `Makefile`
- `doc`: document your application here, and take screenshots if that's applicable
- `plan`: plan the structure and evolution of the app in this folder
- `src`: as is tradition
- `test`: you better put things in there

Replace this file with a description of your app
